# ⚡ Samoa Lightning Remittance MVP

A Lightning Network-based remittance prototype to reduce the cost of sending funds from Australia to Samoa. This project represents a critical first step toward building a regulatory-compliant, open-source payments infrastructure that empowers Pacific communities with sovereign digital tools.

---

## 🌍 Purpose

Remittances are a vital lifeline for Samoa, accounting for over 20% of national GDP. Yet, fees often exceed 8–10%. This project aims to **lower costs by over 4%** using Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, delivering tangible savings to families and improving financial access for thousands of Samoan seasonal and diaspora workers.

---

## ⚙️ Current Status

- ✅ **Bitcoin Core** and **LND nodes** deployed in Docker (`australia`, `samoa`, and `bitcoind`)
- ✅ **Test payments successful** across Lightning Network in regtest mode
- ✅ Developed daily test routines, troubleshooting procedures, and automation documentation
- 🔄 Actively testing channel management, payments, liquidity routing, and node reliability
- 🔄 Engaging with Samoa regulators to enable a **regulatory sandbox** environment

## 🏛️ Regulation & Compliance

This prototype is being developed in close alignment with Samoa's emerging digital and e-commerce strategies. We are:
- Consulting on **regulatory licensing** and **sandbox environments**
- Designing compliance paths for **custody**, **liquidity**, and **exchange operations**
- Preparing open-source tooling to help regulators audit and monitor flows
- Seeking strategic partnerships for fiat gateway and KYC integration

---

## 🚀 Vision

This remittance gateway is the first step toward:
- Building sovereign financial infrastructure in the Pacific
- Establishing **Bitcoin-backed reserves** for small nations
- Enabling **decentralized public services** and donor transparency
- Scaling open-source payment rails across Tonga, Fiji, and other islands
